# Apollo Engine

## What?

Apollo is just my own spin on a C++ game engine. Not my first try either, in fact, this is the second iteration of a project formerly called Breakout. I became dissatisfied with the way I had built the core of the engine, and I figured it was as good an opportunity as any to leverage the full potential of SDL3!
Thus, this rendering backend of the engine uses SDL's new GPU API to handle to low-level graphics shenanigans.

## Why?

I'm deeply interested in game engine programming, this project is just meant to be a learning exercise more than anything.
If you want an engine to make games, this probably isn't the right tool for the job, there are many infinitely better alternatives out there. Check out [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) if you haven't already.
If you're clueless about game engines, and want to get some insight into how they're put together: welcome, make yourself at home, feel free to look around!
